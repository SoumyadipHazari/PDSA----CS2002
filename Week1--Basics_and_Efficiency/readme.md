# Week 1 – Python Foundations  
**Index and Summary of Topics**

---

## 1. Computing GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

- Definition of gcd  
- Why gcd always exists  
- Brute-force methods:  
  - Listing all common factors  
  - Returning the largest factor  
- Improved methods:  
  - Using repeated subtraction  
  - Using modulo operation  
  - Euclid’s Algorithm (efficient)  
- Time complexity and proof idea  
- Example walkthroughs (5, 7, etc.)

## 2. Computing Prime Numbers

- What makes a number prime  
- Why 1 is not prime  
- Basic prime-checking methods:  
  - Listing all factors  
  - Checking divisors from 2 to n−1  
  - Checking up to n/2  
  - Breaking on the first divisor  
- Efficient method:  
  - Checking only up to √n  
- Counting primes using `primesupto()`  
- Examples (5, 7, composite numbers, etc.)

## 3. Exception Handling

- What exceptions are  
- Common error types:  
  - SyntaxError  
  - NameError  
  - ZeroDivisionError  
  - IndexError  
  - File errors (missing file, full disk)  
- try / except usage  
- Handling specific exceptions  
- Handling multiple exceptions  
- General exception handling  
- else block: running code only if try has no errors  
- Why exception handling is useful in programs

## 4. Classes and Objects (Introduction to OOP)

- Abstract Data Types (ADTs)  
- Separating implementation from specification  
- What a class is (template / blueprint)  
- What an object is (instance of a class)  
- `Point` class example:  
  - `__init__` constructor  
  - translate()  
  - odistance()  
  - `__str__` for printing  
  - `__add__` operator overloading  
- Creating and using objects (`p = Point(3,4)`)  
- Example outputs  
- Additional class example: BankAccount  
  - deposit(), withdraw(), show()
